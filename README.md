# LeagueFixture

**LeagueFixture** is a simple Java application that generates a round-robin league fixture based on a list of teams.

## Features

- **Round-Robin League System**: Each team plays against every other team both home and away.
- **Odd Number of Teams Support**: If the number of teams is odd, a "Bye" team is added. Teams matched with "Bye" do not play that week.
- **Fixture Output**: The fixture is displayed weekly, showing home and away teams.
